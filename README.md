# 3Dream â€” Dream it. Draw it. Hold it.

3Dream uses cutting-edge AI to turn any sketch into a 3D model that you can customize and transform into a real, manufactured toy. From imagination to creation in just a few clicks.

## Development

So, how does it work?
1: 3Dream takes a file upload of a sketch from the user
2: The app uses the Gemini API to generate a photo rendering from the sketch
3: After approval and edits from the user, we use the [Tripo AI API](https://www.tripo3d.ai/) to generate a 3D model

**Underlying Technology:** Svelte Kit, Node.js, SASS, Gemini, Tripo AI, Vercel
